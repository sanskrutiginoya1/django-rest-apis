"Honest review of an edm music lover
","No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.

This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go.

"Extremely good BT earphones!! Loud and Super BASS.
","Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.

"Good Earphones with good sound quality and build quality
","Received this BoAt 255 earphones yesterday evening.Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.

"Overall good but not that worth
","he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.

"Review update - Product failed after a few months
","Update: Sadly this is the second Boat product to conk off after few months of use. I guess this is the end of the journey for you and I Boat Audio, not buying any more products from your brand. Changed the rating to reflect the same.I was in the market for a cheap pair of Bluetooth earphones and I chanced upon this on a lightning deal and bought it. I have used Boat products before, they have good build quality and their sound is alright. I’m writing this after a month or so, enough time to have lived with it and get to know quirks and other problems.• The sound is nothing great, it’s a bit on the bassy side. If you’re a bass lover, this is definitely a good buy.• Connectivity is quick and painless – and it works without hassle every time. The quality of the connectivity depends and is sometimes weird. I can put the phone on charge and use it for a distance of about 3 meters, no worries. But sometimes when I’m walking really fast or jogging there are breaks and crackles in audio. Not sure if it’s the material of my gym wear, but it works well when the phone’s in my jeans.• Battery life is nothing to write home about – I listen to music constantly even when I’m at work. My demands are probably too high for this price range.• It is sweat-proof as advertised. No interruptions under a light drizzle.• It’s got great build quality for the price – looks and feels premium. Doesn’t tangle at all.• It stays in your ear regardless of the intensity of the exercise which is great.On the whole a great buy if you are looking for a cheaper alternative. Wait for a sale before you get it though.Like my reviews? Please do click the helpful button. It encourages me to share more about the products I use. Thanks!

"Good sound quality
","Audio quality is pretty good and the way it speaks bye amigos when turning it off is also unique.It's durable and designed right.It has mic opening towards down and engraved and rest of the headphone is completely covered,which makes it water resistant I guess.Only things is that it looks weird when you leav it hanging around the neck unlike some other bluetooth headphones which have hard collar kind thing and then a wire stretching out of it. As it hangs too low from neck and the those hard collar kind ones look like small neck accessory when left hanging.Either way I liked the product and it does the job. Battery back is also really good.

","Close your eyes and just go for it. It is amazing at its price. I have got it at a festival sale which costs me 999 rupees. There is everything perfect in these bluetooth earphones. The bass is amazing even more than sony and jbl bt earphones. The sound is crystal clear. Mic quality is decent and battery life is about 6-7 hours of playback. Noise cancellation is pretty enough. I am very impressed from these earphones. And at last these earphones are stereo supported so you can enjoy 360 songs and also play pubg with these bluetooth earphones. Really i love boat.

"Frequent failures.
","The item has been rendered defective three times in less than two months of usage. The first two times was due to charging issue and the third time due to sound distortion. Being under warranty, the item has been repaired the first two times and now I have registered a compliant for the third failure. The product has spent more time at the service centre than I have used it. Am completely dissatisfied with the reliability of the product.

"Puchase it for sub 1000 price during offers otherwise it will be too expensive for its quality.
","Purchased it for 999. And the price does justifies its quality but for music purposes it does lags. Bass is still justified for its price. Basic functions dont work as desired like overriding the use of buttons.  The startup and shutting down voice is very annoying. Could have kept very subtle.And also battery drains out quickly.  The microphone is the worst.  The person at the other end wont be able to hear you clearly. The built quality is very cheap.  Dont expect it to be durable for long just keep it safe.Also when I used it during running the audio started to interrupt regularly which was very very annoying. I had to abstain from using it during morning jog.  After this experience am giving it only 2 stars.

"Average product
","The reason for this being an average product is that the pros are excellent but the cons also work against it.Pros:>Good noise cancellation>Excellent sound quality>Range is not bad>Good battery lifeCons:>The soft earbuds have a very small hole in it, so when you wear a helmet over it and if there is a slight change in the angle of the earpiece you are unable to hear anything from that earpiece unless you correct the angle.>Durability: The left earpiece of my headphones stopped working within 2 months of use. The company repaired it and gave it back, but the time taken for the same was long. Also, the left earpiece projects lower sound than the right one.>It does not inform when the Bluetooth gets disconnected after going out of range.>Becomes useless after the battery reaches 20%. It keeps informing 'Oops! Battery low!' after every minute for the next 10 minutes and then switches off.

"Great earphones fir bass, MIC has no noise cancellation
","Its grear earphones. I was sceptical when i bought it for 1499, as price was so less for wireless ear phones. Bass is on point and battery life is approx 8-9 hours. You hardly feel it in your ears.  Mic picks up all the noise so thats one minus but you can still hear the the sound. Mic is very sensitive so you can speak almost for yourself and still other person will get you.

"No Second Thought.....Just Go for It.........
","I got this product by 03/12/18 by 04:45 PM. Immediately opened the package to see how the condition was, however it came in a well packed box and on top of it Amazon's insulated cover with invoice. Opened the headphone and put charging through laptop for a few minutes and started using it.Pros:1. Connecting to my new OnePlust 6T within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating ""You are now connected to Boat Rocerz 255""2. Base is really awesome, able to hear vocals properly, well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time3. Call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok4. Music is so good to listen while driving.Cons:1. Multi-functional is not so compatible to my phone (it's my assumption), where I could not able to got to the next song or previous song.2. Noise Cancellation is not that much awesome but yeah can able to listen our voice properly by the other side.3. If we give pause for 5 minutes to the song while listening through this, you should go back again to your phone to replay it againOverall it's a satisfactory deal and worth every rupee we spend on it. As this is my second product from Boat I strongly recommend this.

"Not a great product but great for price.
","I got it for INR999 and that's the reason am giving it a 4star rating. For casual listeners , it has decent sound . I found it very clear not comparable to Hi-res earphones (ofcourse). It has good amount of bass but not deep bass instead more of a muddy bass but what else can you expect at this price. But it is good for casual music but i found it little weird for watching movies. Connectivity is ok . Not great cause if you'll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets , the  connection gets lost. Moreover , since it's a  Bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. Build quality seems good but only time can tell that. I have another boat product called Boat Rockerz 600 ( it was their flagship product then) , which is a very good product. I have it for more than an year now and it's still running very strong though i don't use it as my daily driver. Only problem is that it's earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. And if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like Boult, tagg and all don't bother they all are Chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as Boat or tagg etc. So i believe they should sound very similar. And the MRP written on them is basically a maketing gimmick. There's no way these kinda earphones could cost more than INR1500.And now for "" Audiophiles"" ,well if you are one , you won't be looking at these anyway. So that's it . Happy shopping.

"Not great sound performance but overall ok
","Hi, i bought this for 1500 from amazon but to tell you did not found out this worth 1500. Bought this after seeing 4 star rating from amazon users but seriously not worth 4 stars.1. Bass may be there but the sound is not powerfull and sharp. I tried to switch between plug in ear phone and boat wireless and found that the sound is not great although bass may be there.2. As some user has mentioned the mic is not good which i also feel3. If you arr looking for style then it doesn't look stylish. The earphone wires should come from behind not front as it looks odd.4. Noise cancellation is good.5. Ear comfort is ok.If i have to buy again i would rather by wireless earphone at 600 bucks from metro station amd may feel disappointed rather than spending 1500 buck and feeling disappointed.This product should be in the range of 600  to 800 maxStill if you need something desperately wireless and at some affordable cost then its ok.Have heard from some colleagues that you may find some good wireless earphone from Ali express

Look is awesome but wires are too lengthy.3. Battery Backup 'WAS' awesome. Six to seven hours after 1 or 1.30 hours chargingBUT4. Product is not CHARGING AFTER ONLY TWO DAYS OF PURCHASE. And it is not acceptable. That's why the rating is ONE (lesser than one is not available though)I will change my ratings and review too but after the replacement or refund against this product.And one more thing, do not put too deep to this thing in your ears, it might be painful after few minutes.RegardsSIDDHARTH

"It is just Best among the other worsts. Just a Earphone wirthout jack. Nothing more to expect.
","It was priced around 2.7K initially. But I definitely know it doesn't worth it. I got it in an offer for Rs.1.1K. Still it is not worth the price. I was just looking for some stuff, without having to plug in the 3.5mm jack to my mobile - and it serves that purpose. Other than that, it is not for music lovers who wants to listen to music for long hours. in 30 minutes it starts hurting and I started to develop ear/headache if I continue to listen more than 1 hr. Definitely not suitable for laptops - it keeps disconnecting frequently for no reason. Recently it starts doing the same with my mobiles as well. Battery is not great with daily 1 hours of hearing battery lasts max 3 days. The string is annoyingly long, it dangles upto your stomach. I have seen earphones with reasonable length, this one is awkwardly designed. You cannot wear them without getting attention from onlookers.If you are ready to spend another 1000 bucks go for good brands like JBL, Senheiser etc. If you want to cut cost, well this is the Best among the other worsts in the market

","Just got this and I must say that the build quality is great. Coming to the sound it has really good bass. Can't comment of the battery yet as I just got it. I will update the review later after checking the battery backup.Edit: So, after using it for few days, the battery easily lasts for a day and half a per my usage which includes 1-1.5 hrs of music, one movie (1.5-2hrs) and one episode of Tv series (40-50mins). I end a with 40% battery left as per above usage.

"Good at it's price.
","I bought these earphones on 23 March. My experience with these headphones is quite great. I got delivery on time, packing was great and sealed. So talking about functioning- it comes with the sound quality you will love. Bass is good enough to make your toes move. Mic is of good quality, Noise cancellation could have been even better but I think thats great for this price range. Works with dual phone and for for about 7-8m radius. Battery backup is good. Though it has 10 min charge system, full battery charging takes time. Buttons are working well. Build quality is superb. In short you can go for it if you are thinking to buy it.

"Earphone cables are a bit lengthy that makes irritation
","In terms of price range it is a good earphone but not the best one. Sound quality is good, no issues with battery life and also feels very comfortable around your neck. Sometimes the connection was breaking while you are travelling by vehicle but it is not a big issue as it happens rarely. The only thing that I did not liked was the length of cable. It was really a bit long that can make some disturbance to you especially when you are not listening to music and casually hangs it from your neck. However the magnetic effect was working very fine.

Like 5mins before it was still 80% and out of nowhere suddenly it went down to 20% this really pissed me off and within 30 seconds battery down totally dead...horrible.I'll check it again tomorrow if I still the same problem persist I'll have to replace the item between the build quality, sound, call quality is really good.That's all for now amigos.

"Not good for workouts
","The wire from the band to the ears is too long. Previously, I was using Skull Candy (which i lost so went in for a cheaper option). Skull Candy wire length was perfect. In Boats Rockerz, because the wire is too long, it keeps bumping against my neck when i run. The sound of the wire hitting the neck echoes in the ear pieces. Also, when i do floor exercises, the longish wire hangs uncomfortably around the neck. Sound quality and battery life is decent for the price, though. So if you plan to buy it for casual listening, go ahead. Wouldn't recommend for serious workouts.

"Good but not the best
","I have bought this earphone once , replaced once and finally about to get refund after i returned it second time. Thanks Amazon and seller for initiating the refund. I am not a sound specialist but i am a good listener. My first lengthy review is below.Pros:1. BASS, really heavy bass.2. while listening to music, Double press invokes the last phone call . On the GO call. So when riding in bike it is useful to call my wife ;-)3. can use it when wearing a helmet.4. really good wires and sturdy. So life of the earphone is assured.5. Neck design if u like it.6. Easy to connect. Range/Connectivity is good even when there are many obstacles in between.Cons:1. Mic is at the end of the neck design i.e not closer to mouth. So the other person on the call can't hear properly. Mic picks up so many noise as no MEMS in this.2. Bass is not everything in music. Too much of bass. Even equalizer adjustments to reduce the bass does not help.3. Battery life is mediocre when compared to others.I have bought Mi basic bluetooth headset after returning this.Pros: Dynamic enjoyable bass even at higher volume, MIC noiseless,Cons: wire quality is poor. have to keep it carefully.CHEERS!!!

","Worth buying this product if you have a limitted budget of 1.5 KJust to note this earphone comes with bluetooth v 4.1 and CSR 8635 chipset, but there is a confusion with amazon itself... in desc its mentioned 4.1 however in pictures its shown as 4.2.. The seller is selling us version 4.1. Please amazon correct it!!

"One of the worst earphone I’ve had
","I’ve been using this for past few months now.At first glance, the product seems good and because it does its purpose as wireless audio earphone.Operation wise, there are few things that annoys me a lot.1. During charging there’s no LED indicator. So sometimes if cable is loose or something you won’t know that it’s not charging.2. The on/off switch is not UX friendly. you can’t tell by touch if you’re pressing  volume buttons or power button. All Buttons are diamond shaped. Extremely annoying when you’re in a hurry.3. The Bluetooth pairing is not intuitive. You have to switch on phone Bluetooth and then the earphone. If you switch on the earphone and then the phone Bluetooth, the earphone won’t initiate pairing(I know it’s not the problem with iPhone, because my previous Bluetooth used to work this way) . This is very stupid. So you have to re-start the earphone.4. Double press on volume buttons doesn’t perform next/previous function. Other earphones are capable of this very basic function.5. Occasional buzz or distortion. Sometimes there is a buzzing distortion. On restart of the earphone it goes away.

"Good Quality Sound but observed other problems
","Boat rockerz BT headphone.1. Product quality is decent. Sound quality is good. Works perfectly as an in-ear headphone, as you won't hear much outside noise or even outside sounds once you're plugged in.2. You will hear audio assists when you switch it on, pair it to Bluetooth, switch off etc. That is a good feature.3. Placement of the earpiece is problematic. I found it difficult to place it initially, but I figured it out later. Now, after 3-4 days of use, my ear hurts because I have been placing them in ear. So that's a bad thing.4. I noticed that the headset attracts a lot of dust when used. So on the black headset, you can see dust particles sticking on.

","I have been using the headset for 2 months. The battery life is pathetic. It might huff and puff to 4-5 hrs before the annoying ""your battery is low"" notification starts piercing your ears. The noise cancellation is avergae and the Mic is the biggest let down. When I use this for calls when I am in my room, my sound gets diffused in the sound my ceiling fan makes and the other party will be having lots of difficulty hearing us. And the ear pains a lot after half an hour of usage due to the ear-holder kind of thing provided on the buds. I won't recommend this to anyone. I read and watched a lot of reviews before buying this. Most reviews were rating it pretty high. So I have learned one thing, do not go solely on these reviews when buying things from these kinds of manufacturers, those might be paid ones..!Happy Shopping!!

"Honest, unbiased review. Won't recommend buying this.
","I don't usually write reviews for products but I must do for this one to let people know about the issues I am facing. I will try to cover all aspects of these earphones in this review.*Reliability:*The earphones get disconnected after some time if you don't use it for like 3-4 hours. It's very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. Also, when you pick up the call you don't know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don't know whether they are connected. Though a small issue, it's really frustrating, trust me.*Experience:*The earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected, disconnected, battery low. But what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep, but a long sentence it says ""Oops, battery low"". This keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. If the battery is low, it should just beep if they have to. But every time bugging is not a good experience.Also, it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. You have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.*Sound Quality:*The first song I listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. But it's not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.*Build Quality:*Build quality is really good. No issues with that.*Battery life*Satisfied with battery life. But it doesn't last that long as promised. But I am okay with that.

","This is a great product. Comes in a nice box and it fits perfect in ears. The sound quality is also very nice. I tested it with couple of different songs and it is too good. I was waiting to buy it and to my luck it came on sale for 999 which is a steal price!!!!!.... I am super happy with this product... I am not sure if price will be available as the normal sale price i saw was 1900+ which I guess might be little expensive but I got it for the real deal so happy happy. 😇

"Sound quality is not good, over bassed
","I brought this one, after using boAt Nirvanaa Uno. Uno had good quality stereo with nice bass. This is sounds like a mono headset. I think bass is too much or not set correctly. It sounds differently on Mobile  and PC. I am not satisfied with the sound output. It connects to both PC and Mobile same time, so attending mobile call and Skype call with no hassle. For Rs. 1990 there are better quality available. I trusted boAt based on my previous purchase with UNO.

"Good one but not great !
","Eventhough it connects two divices at the same time, however audio doesn't switch to the first device connected.  While playing the audio from the first device connected, it doesn't work. Only it works for last device connected. We need to reconnect the previous device to get it works.Not sure manufacturing defect or functionality limitation.  Atleast it works flawlessly for other bluetooth headset like Jabra.ANyway it's light weight and sound quality is better than many other product of same price range

"Good buy at an affordable price
","I was looking for a pair of bluetooth earphones to use during my gym workouts and I found these for Rs. 999 during a sale event. Here's my review after 1 week of using this product -Pros:1) Excellent bass quality. You'll love these earphones if you are a bass lover.2) The earphones are lightweight and the magnetic tip makes it easy to carry around neck. I find them really convenient to use at the gym3) Good noise cancellation & sweat resistant.Cons:Battery life - boAt claims a battery life of 6 hours but these run out much before that. It shuts down even though my phone displays 20% battery leftEar pain - The ear buds are not the most comfortable pair you can find. My ears start hurting after prolonged usageMic - The voice quality is not that great and not preferred for taking calls.Overall it's a good buy for the price range.

"The “Boat” experience !!
","I feel they are the best in the business. They have come out with exceptional quality, awesome product at the exact right price point. Awesome accoustic experience is what Boat provides and i would go so far to say that they are the Bose of their price point. I have been using Boat rockerz 250 in the past and those lasted well over 3 years while delivering exceptional music experience throughout. The battery started to give way after 2 yrs but that is expected of all these products. The 255 have better sound quality in terms of bass, accoustic, treble if compared to the 250.The wire is a bit too long for my liking but that’s probably cause i had gotten used to the short wire of the 250.I am sure these will again last me well over 2 years. My brother didn’t listen to me and bought noise shotz and he is regretting his decision now. Poor sound quality, battery quality, connection issues are some of the issues with the noise shotz.Everyone should give them a try once.I had skullcandy before and they were replaced by the company 4 times in the first year while the warranty was active and i had to throw them away after the warranty expired as the 5th piece also malfunctioned. The Boat experience though has been an awesome soundblowing experience.

"Setting Your Expectations Right
","At Rs.1499, there are few areas that boAt delivers and largely others where it doesn't. Noise cancellation and bass are it's highlights while you might have to compromise with the poor build quality, sub-par sound clarity and battery life.With 1 week's experience and daily usage I have come to find:1. The battery doesn't support more than 3-4 hours of playtime, even at 70% volume.2. Great bass which might sometimes overshadow the mid and high tones.3. One of the earbuds has stopped working for which I have ordered a replacement and will post an update on the same.@Amazon/Appario: Excellent all-round experience from order placement to delivery to replacement initiation.

"A budget all-rounder by boAt
","I have been using boAt wireless headphones since two years they have never disappointed me.This is my 3rs boat wireless headphones but i must say this one impressed me alot according to the price segment (Rs 999),it's doing a perfect job of delivering good quality of sound.Regarding the battery life its is 6hrs, but its quite Ok since i have purchased it for 999rs only i can't expect much from it.Coming to sound quality it has a bit more bass, the bass is more than treble but not a problem for those who love high bass.Overall sound quality is more than good in this price segment.The build quality is not that high quality but yes it is sturdy enough to withstand normal drops.Acording to me the length of cord is too lengthy.One thing i dint like about boaAt is connectivity range, the range of connectivity for this is less than 10m,but again budget matters. Given a thought i had paid only 999rs,i am very much satisfied with overall performanceRegarding service center, the customers leaving in Mumbai has added advantage as i had.My previous boat rockerz 275 one earpieces suddenly stopped so i visited the service center in Goregaon and they replaced my headphones with new in just 5 minutes without any questions asked.So customers in Mumbai don't worry about the warranty.

"Think twice before buying!!!
","I also own a Bose premium headphones which I think I cannot wear everyday to gym, so I bought this product for my day to day workouts. Comparing it with Bose, sound is not that crisp but for a Bluetooth earphone under 2k it worth it. I really like the beats and sound is pretty awesome too.Full marks for that, but I find it pretty annoying while working out in gym. There is a U shaped clip at the end of which two wires are attached which connects to earphones. The sturdy clip has to hang round your neck all the time. If you are running, the clip might start rotating and that would slowly force one of the earbud come of your ear. Pretty annoying...believe me, you have to turn the clip time and again to hang it around your neck in correct position. Also, while doing ab crunches it will keep on falling back and take both the earbuds along with it.I was mislead with the pictures, I thought it is all wire and no clip but its not. Just wanted to point this out so you dont make the same mistake ;)But if you are not into too much workout and want it for travel, then connection range and awesome beats is great deal.Cheers.

For example, if you have your phone in your handbag/backpack/pocket, you can expect multiple cut offs, especially while moving (walking, using a scooter/motorcycle). If you move further away you need to be in direct sight of the phone for continuous music (if you turn your back to the phone or if there is any obstruction (not even a wall, a bathroom stall door is all it takes) the music gets cut off. Not sure if it is just my piece but this is very frustrating.The ear pieces have magnets so that it connects around your neck when not in use, however this makes each ear piece heavier, as a result if you are using smaller in-ear buds, they tend to fall out due to the weight of the ear piece. This becomes a hassle while working out, particularly jogging/running.

"Bass lover here. But gets too bassy
","Issues.Cinnectivity.---------------The Bluetooth connectivity is not at all good. Just breaks some times. Not at all recommended for gym workout( atleast not for cardio.) Stopped working many times when I had a good amount of sweat.Sound.I am a bass lover and always a budget guy. Till now used different kinds of in ear earphones. Senhizer cx 180.. jbl . Panasonic, boat, etc.. all in same range approx. But i still prefer senihizer cx 180 over boat 225.  Boat just has too much of base the voice mainly feels submerged. I had to turn off all the equalizers ( music app and mobile ) so that I could get a better voice..however it feels too bass. Atleast not while listening to music but it feels while watch a movie speciallly Hollywood.Disappointed a bit.. satisfiesld a bit.. but majorly disappointed

"Best for the price of under 1300/-
","First of all, for 999 it's the best.So I'm reviewing this as a 13-1500 rs device.After 3 months of usage-Soung quality is very good for the price.Bass is also very good.Range is 'decent'.You'll become used to in 2-3 days of usage it's comfortable (it's light as )Connectivity and usability is also very easy.Mic will work well most of the time, just ensure it's at the right place.But one thing I'd say you after 3 months of usage that build quality us 'above average' that's all, especially you have to be very careful with the wires.

"Just the perfect earphone you need for everyday !!
","Actually a product worth buying.. I have mostly been a fan of quality products than brand names.. Boat has come up with a product that does just everything it is supposed to do.. I got it for under 1k on one of the sale days and that's why it's even more of a satisfying buy.. my views on this after using my Boat Rockers for almost over a month extensively..1. Sound is quite good..bass is quite good for regular use (I mostly listen to Psychedelic, Techno and Rock, performs genuinely on all the genres)2. Lightweight - I have slept wearing it twice, never realised..!!3. Good battery life- goes on easily for 6-7 hours with one charge..(mix of usage and standby)4. Love the color- I have a red and black colour one..looks super classy..5.noise cancellation is good. Blocks out pretty much all of the ambient sound even in the middle of noisy surroundings..All in all..I am happy I waited a long time to buy a genuine wireless earphone and Boat Rockers made it worth the wait..Cheers team Boat..!!

"Terrible sound quality.
","Terrible sound quality. I don't have much idea about songs from the EDM, pop genre but if you are one who's into rock/metal or the likes then stay as far away from this as possible. The sound clarity is terribly. Lows can be lived with, the mids would make you hate your decision to buy, the highs would make you kill yourself. Noise cancellation is satisfactory but nothing beyond that. Charging never seemed a hassle to me and lasts a decent amount of time on battery. Build quality is good however it's only been a week. In terms of comfort, never really had any issues despite running it for a continuous 2-3 hours once. Buds are soft and fit in snugly. Bluetooth connectivity is strong, however there are times when the connection stutters.And yes, it cannot be refunded,only replaced. So purchase wisely.

"Conquers the competition...
","Build: Well designed, lightweight and comfortable. The wires are good and not flimsy, wearing comfort is well maintained, better than Mi bluetooth earphones( the main competitor of boAt in the 1499 price category).Comfort: As mentioned above, these earphones are really comfortable, fits in the ear with no chance of slipping out (unless you're trying desperately and internationally). They're lightweight, so no hazard on that department. Perfect for long hours of music playback.Sound: The most important aspect of an earphone is the sound clarity, and boAt surely doesn't disappoint here as well. A bit base heavy but the sound is clear, crisp and loud. Good noise cancellation also helps to isolate the music playback. Although, judging from a pure audiophile's point of view, the Mi bluetooth earphones might have a more balanced sound signature, but boAt, being a bit base heavy, is just awesome for hip-hops or Bollywood genres. A music player with a good equalizer (preferably Poweramp for android) is going to elevate the listening experience even more.Battery: A single charge gives about 6-7 hours of music playback, which is decent enough, and full charge takes roughly about 1-1.5 hours.Verdict: In a nutshell, boAt Rockerz 255 is worth the price tag and then some. With it's better build quality, comfort, bluetooth range, it packs more punch than it's competition. For the extreme purists, the sound signature might be a bit turn off, but for most people, even for people with good ears, this is going be a great experience.

"Just ok product. Otherthan bass quality nothing great about
"," Bass is extremely good. No doubt. mic clarity is very poor, especially during outside. Mic noise cancelation is not effective. Ear buds are comfort enough and completely conceals the ears so during driving you should use only one side, otherwise you cannot hear the other vehicles horns etc., After usage for some long time of 1hr or so it pains in the ears. Battery back up is 4 to 5hrs hardly. Please be careful that once battery charge comes down to 20%, it switches off...bluetooth connectivity range is very short.

"Realistic Review of these Earphones.
","To those who doesn't get to know the realistic review about this product.I've been using it for 2 days and understood the sound quality. And i F-u-kin love these earphones.Noise Cancellation is very good. You can't hear noises until you try to hear them.Comfortability. You can't listen for a longer period of time. It will start paining after 20 mins. These were not comfortable until i removed the wings. And i had some old eartips which i am using right now. These are more comfortable to me. And now i can listen to 4 hours straight without paining.Battery life is excellent. Used for 2 days and battery percentage dropped from 100 to 40%.Now the Sound Quality.Mids are average. Won't miss any sound.Highs (treble or vocals) is not up to the mark. BUT, If you adjust the equaliser settings then you can make it sounds so amazing.Lows (bass) is SO POWERFUL. Rockerz 255 was only made for the bass lovers i guess. Their only focus was on the bass. These earphones have extra bass.(i am saying this so many times because it literally has so much bass)The people who are saying that it would have been better if it had more bass are stupid as fun.I have used some high and mid end earphones like Sony Mdr xb55 with extra bass, Jbl T110 and Oneplus Bullets.At first when i heard, i thought i made a mistake by purchasing these Earphones but when i equalised it. I made it sounds like some high end earphones. And i am very happy with the purchase now.You will only like this if you didn't have an high end earphones. But if you have never heard an high end earphones and wants some eargasm then i must say that you should go with the product. You'll be happy with the purchase and dont forget to equalise.

","Stopped working in 3 months.Claimed warranty but it takes forever..still haven’t received the replacement as well as no email or SMS or call from Boat.Don’t buy these earphones...spent a little extra and buy Sony or JBL at least their products a good and if any issues they treat their customers better and resolve the issue quickly.I already bought another Bluetooth earphones and I guess I’m gonna wait for 7-8 months for Boat to replace their faulty product.

"Best in budget
","It has been a month since I got these earphones and these are my first own Bluetooth earphones. However, I have tried many other earphones and headphones from different brands from my friends like boat, Samsung, sony, Skullcandy, jaybird, house of marley. I finally settled for this one because it's giving more than it's worth when compared to others. These are cheap in cost and rich in sound. Casual music listeners will enjoy this earphones thoroughly.I will list some pros and cons that a casual music lover looks for...Pros :1)Deep boosted bass and balanced music at higher volumes...worth for money2)Good fit, Light weight and flexible neck band with sweat and water resistant... perfect for workout3)Around 6 hours of play time at 80% of full volume and around 1.5 hour for full charge4) multi function buttons and different bud sizesCons....1) little noise at the beginning that fades out as soon as the music starts2) disconnection ( lag in music ) due to displacement of device for the first time only. It gets settled after the first time you move it and stays connected with out any further disruption.

"Lousy headphones
","I primarily use this headset for my daily bike ride to farm which is full of pot holes , trenches and bad roads. When I listen to music I tend to forget these obstacles and focus on my day to day goals. Day one use was okay. However now whenever I plug this with any of my Bluetooth device, I hear screeching sound just like old days mobile network coverage sound. I tried changing my mobile with other however problem continues. Also if you add another 500rs to will get jbl ones better than this boat rocker. Absolutely waste of money.

"Poor quality? I would say so.
","This was a product suggested by many but with my comprehensive use of over two months I can say it's not a good product. The battery life on this thing is highly inconsistent even when I'm listening to music at same volume( It has happened quite a few times that I charge it to a 100 at night but it doesn't last more than an hour ). The second issue I want to point out is the Bluetooth connectivity. This device connected in a blink for a month or so, but then it used to suddenly disconnect from my device. After a month I started facing issues connecting to the device, sometimes ( even with full battery ) the device was not discoverable. As a whole I would not recommend this pair of wireless earphones.

"Not lasting and 1 year warranty is useless as supplier is not reachable

","The product seemed good initially (including the design, weight balance, sound quality etc). However, within 15 days of use, it has started behaving funny as it gets disconnected after 30 minutes of use (even when mobile is in my pocket).

"This is beyond my expectations.
","More than what I expected. I always brought high end earphones and lately understood that high-end earphones are not worth the price.Hence I went for this budget one (1100 rs).Its really awesome .It’s quality is equal to the high end earphones I had.Never expected such a excellent sound output.There is a good balance between Bass and Treble.Lightweight and raging red colour addsup to the euphoria it creates.

","Over all it is a below average product.-Very uncomfortable in my ear, painful after 15-20mins only.-Sound quality is very low and not clear many a time.- Bass is ZERO.-As you can see in the picture, it is on charging so frequently.- and the WORST part is; you are not allowed to return it even you want to replace it Amazon will replace it with the same product, why the hell I'll order the same product again with so many flaws.Amazon atleast allow me to pick other product.

"Background Noise cancellation not good
","Got the earphones 3 days back. As with other boAt earphones the sound quality including bass is really good, but the background noise cancellation is not good. When i am talking on phone, the quality of sound heard by the person on the other side is not good with lot of background noise from my side, which doesnot happen with wired earphones or talking without earphones. Battery backup till now is good. No other issues.

"Completly waste
","Writing review after using 2 months of the product. Initially the sound quality was good and the connectivity was also good. But after one month of use connectivity problem started. After two month of use one day it suddenly got turned off and I was not able to turn ON the device. I registered complaint on there website and after 2 weeks they pick up the device and now after 2 week they collected for there pick up service. I will never going to buy there product. Pathetic service. Totally time and money wasting.

"Good Headphones worth buying.
","I have used it for 1 day and no complaints till now. Build quality is good. Very light weight. Sound quality is good. It has super extra bass so those who don't like extra bass have to think on it before buying. Battery life is also good 5hour 35 minutes. Saw 2 movies in a day along with attending calls. Charging time is approx 2 hours. One of the good features I like that when you connect to android phone it shows headphone's battery icon next to bluetooth icon. That battery icon show how much charge is left.

","This is disgusting. The product stopped working in exactly 12 days. Bought on 7 Mar 2019 and the return deadline was a 10-day window. This is utter nonsense. Don't know how to return this damn crap now. I'll need to file a suit rather, for the benefit of greater good.Current update as on 26 April: I got the replacement product directly from Boats company and Amazon played no role or assisted in anyway.

"Good bass. Distance 10mtr definitely not.
","Writing this review after one month usage.Product is meant for people who prefer good bass. Sound quality starts dropping once u move away from object let it be like 4-5 meters too initial it was better. As it takes into consideration your body deflection ,and sound of a person talking is like he is in water.battery life is good.sound quality is better as i grabbed it for discount at 1200/₹.Actually would give 3.5 🌟

"A very good product
","Sound Quality : The sound quality is very good... Good baas... At higher volume the bass tends to overpower the vocals but at this price point the audio quality is very good.Battery life : takes around two hours to charge completely. I do not use it continuesly but it can give you around 6 hours of music playback and talk time included.Durability : around the neck design allows the earphone to be used freely... making it tangled free... durability of the wire is also very good.

"Cheap headphones not worth even 500.
","Got it for 999 during a flash sale.The left earphone stopped working properly within a week. Got it replaced.. Thanks to amazon.The replacement is even worse. The battery dies down within 2 hrs of usage. And to top it off, the boat support is being handled by idiots who say that battery damage isn't covered under warranty. Even when i mentioned this is a new earphone hardly used for a week, the answer is same.So just stay away from boat products however lucrative the deal might be.

"Good sound with less durability
","The sound quality of the earphone is good. The base and the noise cancellation is commentable. But I am not Satisfied with the products durability, just usage of 6 months and one side of it is not working. I really am a BOAT fan, but this product didn't survive as per it's name and money. You will find better earphones in same price range or you may have to Shell out a little bit more. Overall rating is just above average for this earphones just because of the durability.

","Sound quality is very good more than expected from a 1499 earbuds. After a long time enjoyed music. Bass is ultimate. Call quality is very good indoors. Didn't test it outdoors yet. I watched lots of best bluetooth devices video reviews and this one is listed in top 3. Hence considered buying it and it has turned out to be a good decision. Happy with it. Will test it more and update. Hope it will give a good battery life. 110 mah should last long

"Average product
","It's noise cancellation isn't very effective. U need to speak loudly for other party to hear your voice. Also, battery goes straight from 100 to 80% and theb to 60% in no time. After this just gives 3-4 warning within 5minutes of play and it'll go off. 60% battery means, it should hold at least for 30-40 mins but it doesn't. Good in terms of bass and sound quality. Overall it's an average product with lots of advertisement and marketing.

"Bass!!
","I like the whole package(build quality, packaging, earbuds ,light weight, super comfy) the battery is good..it's all comes to the sound quality....for a Rs1200-1500 earphone it's too low....it's all bass...nothing but bass...nobody wants that much bass..used loads of other earphones..sound is too bassy...otherwise descent product

"Honest Review for those who have decided ""Jo bhi ho jaye yahi earphone lena hai""
","The product is super but it is not robust. The earphones does not last long. I bought it on Sep 2018 and replaced it since one earpiece was not working within 4 months of purchase. The customer support is excellent but it takes 20 days time for the overall process. Again after 9 months of puchase, one piece is again not working. Sound quality is awesome. One cons is there that while calling, the other person recieves the sound too loudly any it irritates the receiver.

"Sound quality not that great. Functionaly good
","The sound quality takes a big hit. I play have a lot that requires me to listen to audio ques, and I enjoy listening to music. Both of them were affected by the use of these. Also the ear plugs were slightly large and the rubber stiff enough to hurt my ears after continuous use

"Best budget bluetooth earphones
","It is one of the best Bluetooth based wireless earphones currently available in the market. The battery backup usually lasts up to 8 hours of continuous music listening. Since it is in-ear design, hence noise cancellation is good, however, it lacks active noise cancellation, which I am sure is not present in any product of a similar cost.Overall, it is a must buy and good to have.

"Almost fine in all aspects except fitting over neck while riding two wheelers
","I am totally satisfied with the sound quality, durability, noise cancellation mic and finally battery was awesome but as a bike rider I am not going to suggest this one as it doesn't fitting to our neck when we ride two wheeler.When we r driving the band behind the neck  is going back for air which is totally uncomfortable for user and pilon on the bike.For my Samsung galaxy MAX through this bluetooth headphones i can't use Google assistant as I not supporting for my device, I am not sure this problem is for everyone or not

"Not durable, average sound quality
","Sound quality is not so good and not so bad, I'd say average. Bass is good but not so strong with treble. But the main problem is the durability. In 3 months, battery started draining in an just an hour long usage and also phone calls stopped working. This is the second time I'm having a terrible experience with BOAT earphones, earlier with a different model. I'm really starting to think if they're worth it because of this durability concerns.

"Worth for the Price
","Merits:-1. Been using it for last 2 weeks. The earphone's sound and the bass is mindblowing.2. Once if u fix the earphone into the ear you can't hear anything from outside even without playing songs.3. About the charging, they have mentioned 6hrs standby but it will be upto 7 to 9 hrs also if you are  using it continually.4. Sweat proof is also awesome,  Very flexible,  weightless. Demerit:-1. Ear buds are not perfectly fit but u can enjoy enjoy the music.
